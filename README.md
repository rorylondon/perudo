Welcome to my Perudo Project!
This project aims to create a virtual version of the popular Liar's Dice game. 
The final version of the project is undefined, but at a bare minimum it should allow users to play the game on the command line. 
The gameplay logic will be written in Python. Future features may include a front-end allowing users to play in a UI.
